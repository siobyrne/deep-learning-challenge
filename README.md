# deep-learning-challenge
This project uses deep learning neural networks to select funding applicants with the highest chances of success for a fictional non-profit. 

## Code Notes
PNG files of all plots can be found in the images folder. Checkpoint files are located in the checkpoints folder.

## Analysis

By utilizing the names of the applicants in the analysis and adjusting the classifications to 500 and number of epochs to 50, we were able to achieve accuracy of 0.79 and loss of 0.45, within the target range of greater than 0.75 and less than 0.45, respectively.
